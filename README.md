This is a flask api. It can be used as a backend for a online registeration process. single API will serve for the clients and admin who wants to monitor or get the data from the database. It uses POST method to post data for registering and retriving. In this project we host a mysql on localhost and connect it to the application through python's mysql connector. Admin user access is secured with password and admin can retrieve the data with multiple options. API takes JSON file as input. 
Application is tested using postman. Works fine without any error and with right output.
Database is already created outside of this python code.
