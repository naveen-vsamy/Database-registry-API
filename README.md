This is a flask api. It can be used as a backend for online registeration process. This API can serve for both the clients and admin. we takes registeration from clients and pulls/query data securely to admin.
It uses POST method to post data for registering and retriving. In this project we host a mysql on localhost and connect it to the application through python's mysql connector. Admin user access is secured with password and admin can retrieve the data with multiple options.

Application is tested using postman. Works fine without any error and with right output.
